# LaunchPad - 3D Modern Landing Page

## Project Overview
This project is a high-performance, visually stunning landing page built as part of an **Internship Assignment**. It demonstrates the integration of modern web technologies, including real-time 3D graphics, smooth scroll animations, and a responsive design focused on user experience.

The project, titled **LaunchPad**, explores the "3D Web Evolution," pushing the boundaries of traditional web interfaces by merging enterprise-grade performance with immersive 3D elements.

## Key Features
- **Immersive 3D Background**: Utilizes `@react-three/fiber` and `three.js` for dynamic, interactive 3D environments.
- **Advanced Animations**: Powered by `framer-motion` for fluid transitions, scroll-triggered effects, and micro-interactions.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Built with a "Beyond Reality" aesthetic, featuring mesh gradients, glassmorphism, and bold typography.
- **Performance Optimized**: Leverages Next.js 16 (App Router) for superior speed and SEO.
- **Responsive Components**: Fully responsive design across all devices, including:
  - Hero section with 3D depth
  - Feature highlights
